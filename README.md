This is a console-based Baccarat game implemented in C. The project focuses on simulating the basic rules of Baccarat, including card dealing, score calculation, and third-card rules. It also includes a simple text-based interface using console functions such as gotoxy, getch, and SetColor.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Player vs Banker Baccarat rules

- Deck generation using a base-13 encoding method (0‚Äì51 mapping)

- Third card rule logic and split-stage game flow

- Console interface with keyboard navigation and visual effects
